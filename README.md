# CatDogClassifier
Image classification with CNN using the CatDog dataset. This project contains the relevant data, arrays and models.

The jupyter notebook contains the basic instructions for the implementation of the model and a guide on how to create the variables and arrays that are used in the tuner code. In the second code we try many configurations of CNN to find the best model using tensorboard.
